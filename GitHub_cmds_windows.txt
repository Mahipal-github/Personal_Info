In Git Hub CMD(will come when u install git for windows) :-
-----------------------------------------------------------------

1)git init - to initialize .git in local repo which has the history details
2)git status - to check the status of commits on branch master
3)git add MyFile.txt - to add any file that is being staged to be committed to repo
4) git commit -m "Added MyFile" - to commit to repo with the msg 
5) git log - shows most recent committed ones with time and who did it
6) git add MyFile.txt MyOtherFile.txt - to add the changed files to repo
7) git commit -m "Changed Files" - to commit after doing changes in the file
Create a public repo in ur git hub account
8) git remote add origin https://github.com/mahipal/Repo1.git - it will add or make sync the current local repo to the newly created
repo on github
9) git remote -v - to verify whether it is in sync with github
10) git push -u origin master - it will add the local master branch to the Repo1 master branch

If u make any changes in Repo1 directly on github and it is needed to be in sync with local repo then we have three
scenarios 'fetch and merge' or 'pull'

11) git fetch origin master - will take the update file from Repo1 and place it in local repo of .git
12) git merge origin/master - will update the updated file of Repo1 in the local repo
13) git pull origin master  - will automatically do fetch and merge

scenarios after adding readme while creating a new repo
-------------------------------------------------------

1) git remote remove origin - it will break the connection with Repo1 in github
2) git remote add origin https://github.com/mahipal/Repo2.git - it makes sync with Repo2 where readme file exists

If u push like before will not push because both are not in sync because Repo2 contains readme which is not there in local repo
to make both in sync
3) git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories - will add readme in local repo to make sync
4) git push origin master - will push local repo and makes sync

Cloning the git repo Repo3 into local
--------------------------------------

1) git clone https://github.com/mahipal/Repo3.git - will copy the Repo3 which is there in github to local with .git
after that we can use it like before

Branches 
--------

Branches make the code isolated
create another branch for a master branch and make sync after doing changes to other branch
After reviewing and when needed to be merged with master create a pull request and merge it with master branch
