Features of Java
Java 1.8 features
what is Stream API
OOPS concepts in Java
what is abstraction
Diff bw interface and abstract class
can we declare static method and default method in interface
can we create an object of abstract class
How to use the abstract class
what is constructor and types of constructor


can we overload the constructor
--Yes, we can overload the constructor with diff parameters
But default constructor is not overloaded because when we declare constructor default constructor is deleted from the class

can we overload and override the static methods
--Cant override static methods as there is no runtime polymorphism but can overload static methods

what is static variable
what is String in Java
Why String is Immutable


what is aggregation
--It specifies the HAS-A relationship between two classes.
If a class have an entity reference, it is known as Aggregation. Aggregation represents HAS-A relationship.
Consider a situation, Employee object contains many informations such as id, name, emailId etc. It contains one more object named address, 
which contains its own informations such as city, state, country, zipcode etc. as given below.

version control mechansims - git
Diff be git fetch and git pull
what is the purpose of using branches in repository

Can we make a constructor final
--No, constructor cant be made final it will throw modifier 'final not allowed '
Basically constructor cant be inherited to any sub class so it is not required to make constructor final


What are the components of a spring boot
--

what is custom exception and can we implement run time exception
--In Java, we can create our own exceptions that are derived classes of the Exception class. 
Creating our own Exception is known as custom exception or user-defined exception. 
Basically, Java custom exceptions are used to customize the exception according to user need.

How Hash Map works internally
--Hash Map uses Hashing technique
HashMap is a part of the Java collection framework. It uses a technique called Hashing. 
It implements the map interface. It stores the data in the pair of Key and Value. 
HashMap contains an array of the nodes, and the node is represented as a class. 
It uses an array and LinkedList data structure internally for storing Key and Value. There are four fields in HashMap - hash code, key, value and next ref

2 years exp:
------------
what happens if we dont have String[] args in main() - will compile but not run

Answers:
-----------------------
Copy Constructor 
- creates one object from the existing object of the same class
- used mostly when there r complex objects that has several fields and when we need deep copy of the
existing object
- create a copy construct, we can first declare a constructor that takes an object of the same type as a parameter:
Diff bw copy constructor and clone method
- with clone we need to implement cloneable interface and need to handle clonenotsupportedexception
- we cant do copy of vairable declared as final in clone method


constructor chaining
-calling one constructor from another constructor with respect to current object
- Constructor chaining can be done in two ways: 
- Within same class: It can be done using this() keyword for constructors in same class
- From base class: by using super() keyword to call constructor from the base class.


singleton class
-a class is said to be singleton if it limits the number of objects of that class to one.
-We can’t have more than a single object for such classes.
-Singleton classes are employed extensively in concepts like Networking and Database Connectivity.

Dynamic method dispatch - run time polymorphism
- it is a mechanism that helps to resolve when a call to a overridden method is made during run time.
- when a super class reference is created and with the help Java determines which version(superclass/subclasses) of that method is to be executed 
based upon the type of the object being referred to at the time the call occurs. Thus, this determination is made at run time

Overriding and Exception-Handling : Below are two rules to note when overriding methods related to exception-handling.
Rule#1 : If the super-class overridden method does not throw an exception, subclass overriding method can only throws the unchecked exception, 
throwing checked exception will lead to compile-time error.
Rule#2 : If the super-class overridden method does throws an exception, subclass overriding method can only throw same, subclass exception. 
Throwing parent exception in Exception hierarchy will lead to compile time error.Also there is no issue if subclass overridden method is not throwing 
any exception.

Data Abstraction
- Data Abstraction is the property by virtue of which only the essential details are displayed to the user. 
The trivial or the non-essentials units are not displayed to the user. Ex: A car is viewed as a car rather than its individual components.
-Data Abstraction may also be defined as the process of identifying only the required characteristics of an object ignoring the irrelevant details. 
The properties and behaviours of an object differentiate it from other objects of similar type and also help in classifying/grouping the objects.

TechM interview Ques:
---------------------
How to remove duplicates from Array in Java
Diff bw metaspace and premgen space
until java 7 we have a concept of Premgen space, later from java 8 they introduced metaspace
-premgen space usually stores classes and throws java.lang.outofmemory premgen exceptions, from java 8
those doesnt occur becacues they replaced with metaspace
-Permgen space is of fixed size, but metaspace is auto incremented
-Permgenspace has inefficient garbage collection, metaspace has efficient garbage collection
How to handle NullPointerException in Java 8
-using Optional Class
E.g. - Optional<String> st = Optional.ofNullable(str[4]);
       if(st.ispresent{})
{
sop(st.get().toLowerCase());
}
else
{
sop("No string is present");
}
Example of GroupBy using streams in java8
